Video Summarization Using AI: Abstract

Video summarization using AI refers to the process of automatically generating a concise and meaningful summary of a video by selecting the most relevant and informative segments. This technique utilizes advanced machine learning models, particularly deep learning and natural language processing, to analyze and extract key moments, objects, scenes, and dialogue from videos.

The main approaches to video summarization are:

Extractive Summarization: This method involves selecting key frames or video segments directly from the original content to create a reduced version of the video. These selections are made based on factors such as visual cues, motion, speech, and object detection.

Abstractive Summarization: Instead of directly selecting portions of the video, this approach generates a summary that may involve rephrasing or rewriting the content. It often uses advanced natural language processing models to generate textual summaries and may also create condensed video versions with a focus on narrative coherence and context.

AI-based video summarization leverages deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for visual understanding, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal sequence learning, and transformer-based models for contextual and semantic analysis. Additionally, multimodal models that combine visual, audio, and textual inputs are gaining traction in producing richer and more context-aware summaries.

Applications of AI video summarization are wide-ranging, including content recommendation, video search engines, surveillance analysis, media production, and video-based education. By providing efficient, automated ways to condense hours of footage into a few key moments, AI-driven video summarization enhances user experience and makes large-scale video analysis more practical.

This technology continues to evolve, addressing challenges like capturing the "essence" of diverse video content while maintaining quality, relevance, and informativeness in summaries.
